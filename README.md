## Unsupervised Learning project 3

### Customer_Segments


In this project I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. 

First I explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another.

Afterwards, I did preprocessing to the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I applied PCA transformations to the data and implemented clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. 

Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and considered ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
